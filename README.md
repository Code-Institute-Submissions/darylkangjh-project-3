# EatRank | We can't get enough of reviews 

## Introduction 
EatRank is a crowd-source food review website that selects genuine customers from a community of food enthusiast to help review various restaurants in Singapore. The platform aims to moderate between the consumer’s need for credible information while balancing the anonymity of the internet which most famous reviews platform fail to moderate.
At this current stage, the idea for the platform is to have EatRank employees add partner restaurants into our platform while reviewers are verified offline via a 1-day training programme on how to utilise the platform. 
The platform aims to generate revenue from a small platform fee from restaurants and advertisements by “bumping” listings to the top of the page.

## UI/UX 

### Strategy
__Owner Goals__
The site owner aims to use the platform to on-board partner restaurants and encourage more user sign ups. To that end, the initial phase of EatRank will allow verified users to create restaurants themselves by adding in places they have visited and wish to list on EatRank. This is to prove that the concept works and gather initial traffic to the site with an adequate number of restaurant listed.
However, this feature will be temporary and closely monitored by the Team to ensure there is no exploitation of this feature. In future, restaurants can only be added by EatRank staff.
